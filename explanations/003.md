# Problem : 003

The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.

What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?


# Solution :

Every composite number can be written as 
***number = factor1 * factor2***

Lets assume that factor1 is a prime number and factor1 <= factor2 then there will be two cases as discussed below:

**Case 1 :** factor2 is prime and if factor1 is the smallest prime satisfying above product then factor2 is our largest prime factor. Problem solved!!

**Case 2 :** factor2 is a composite number, then start with *number = factor2* and repeat above steps.
